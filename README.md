LOL (League of Legends) game data analysis / analytics

The data crawling part is based on [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods), a wrapper [Cassiopeia](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia) and the database I/O part involves sqlite3 and a bit of some popular libraries like [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
